# Decentralized Subscription Service

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
The Decentralized Subscription Service allows users to subscribe to content or services using Ethereum smart contracts. Payments are made directly to the contract, granting access for a predefined period, without intermediaries.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
Our vision is to create a transparent, permissionless, and censorship-resistant subscription model where content creators and users engage directly on-chain.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Wallet-based user subscriptions.
- Time-bound access automatically enforced.
- Adjustable subscription fee and duration.
- Owner withdrawal of collected subscription funds.
- Emits events for major contract changes for better off-chain integration.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Integration with NFTs for subscription passes.
- DAO-based fee governance.
- IPFS-based content delivery linked with subscription state.
- On-chain analytics for subscription trends.
